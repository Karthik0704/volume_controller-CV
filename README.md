Project Name: Volume Control Hand Gesture Recognition

Description:
This project demonstrates real-time volume control using hand gesture recognition. The system tracks hand movements through a webcam and interprets specific gestures to adjust the volume level of the system. It employs computer vision techniques with the help of the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and OpenCV for image processing. The volume control is implemented using the PyCaw library, which allows interaction with the Windows Core Audio API to adjust system volume programmatically.

Key Features:

Hand gesture recognition for volume control.
Real-time visualization of hand movements and volume adjustments.
Dynamic volume adjustment based on hand gestures.
Supports multiple hand gestures for different volume levels.
Simple and intuitive interface for controlling volume using hand movements.
Customizable gesture recognition and volume adjustment thresholds.
Technologies Used:

Python
OpenCV
MediaPipe
PyCaw
Git
Project Structure:

volumehandcontroll.py: Main Python script implementing volume control through hand gesture recognition.
handtrackingmodule.py: Python module containing the handDetector class for hand tracking and gesture recognition.
.gitignore: Git configuration file specifying files and directories to be ignored in version control.
